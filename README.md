## Telecom Churn Prediction Project

**Welcome to the Telecom Churn Prediction Project!**

### Problem Statement:

High customer churn rate poses a significant financial challenge for telecom companies. Identifying customers at risk of leaving allows for targeted retention strategies, reducing customer acquisition costs and boosting customer lifetime value. This project aims to build a machine learning model to predict churn based on customer data.

### Dataset:

This project uses the dataset from Kaggle The link to the project is here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn

### Approach:

1. **Data Exploration and Cleaning:** Analyze the data to understand its characteristics, distribution, and potential missing values or inconsistencies. Apply appropriate cleaning techniques to ensure data quality.
2. **Feature Engineering:** Extract relevant features from the data that might influence customer churn. This could involve transforming existing features, creating new features, and dealing with categorical variables.
3. **Model Selection and Training:** Compare different machine learning algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost) to identify the best model for predicting churn. Train the chosen model on the prepared data.
4. **Model Evaluation:** Assess the performance of the trained model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Analyze the model's prediction errors and potential improvement areas.
5. **Interpretability and Insights:** Gain insights into the factors influencing customer churn by analyzing the model's feature importance and visualizing key relationships.

### Project Output:

This project aims to deliver:

* A trained machine learning model for predicting customer churn.
* An analysis of the factors influencing churn based on the model's interpretation.
* Recommendations for targeted retention strategies based on the identified churn predictors.
